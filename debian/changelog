mdnsd (0.11) stable; urgency=medium

  * Add support for multiple interfaces, similar to running one
    mdnsd v0.10 per interface, sharing the same .conf files, issue #8
  * Removed `-a ADDR` flag, not applicable anymore
  * The `-i IFACE` option now limits mdnsd to run on one interface
  * Add support for query type ANY, by Peter Fleer, issue #34
  * Create PID file when starting up, and touch on .conf reload.  This
    is used by process supervisors like Finit to acknowledge that the
    process (mdnsd) is done and ready to serve requests again
  * Updated mquery tool to behave a bit more like mdns-scan(1), except
    with more command line options.  mquery still only runs on one
    interface, unlike mdnsd itself
  * Fix #33: multiple code cleanups and minor fixes by Wolfgang Rösler
  * Fix #35: validate port number in .conf file
  * Fix #38: possible NULL pointer dereference and memory leaks when
    reading .conf files, by Wolfgang Rösler
  * Fix #39: multiple fixes by Peter Fleer
  * Fix conflict detection
  * If a conflict is detected, append `-index` suffix to hostname
    to uniqify the name -- this happens in multi-deploy scenarios
  * When reloading .conf files, delete previously published records
  * Drop own, looped back, multicast packets -- only if we detect
    it as our own published records
  * Send publish records only if probes have gone unanswered
  * Fix #43: _ldecomp() breaking on long name offsets, by Chris Beaumont
